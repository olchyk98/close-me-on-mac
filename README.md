## Purpose
Quickly close running applications right from your terminal.
With great control comes ultimate power üí™

## Implementation
For the CLI tool I'm going to use node.js with bun runtime.
For UI components I'm going with `@inquirer/prompts`.
And for shell execution I'm going to use bun's native `$` shell.

## Inspiration for this project
I am a person of multi-tasking. Whenever I am heavily invested in to doing something on my Mac,
I can have many applications opened depending on how I feel. Sometimes I write Code, text
people on Slack, Messages¬†and WhatsUp, compose music and edit videos - all at the same time!

After a long day of work, it becomes harder for me to find applications that I need right
away on my apps dock (bottom bar where running applications are displayed). Closing unused
applications manually has become a tidious process, especially when my entire apps dock is
bloated with a huge amount of running apps.

For this reason I decided to implement this small utility which would allow me to quickly
see all the running applications, search for those I would like (or select all) and close
them all together. So much faster!
